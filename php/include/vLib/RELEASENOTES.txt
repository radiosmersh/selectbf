Version
--------


4.0.1 RC1
 |
 |
 |-- vlibSearchToSQL new class
 |    This class is an **EXPERIMENTAL** new class for taking a boolean search term,
 |      i.e.: cats -dogs
 |    turns it into a string that you can add to your WHERE clause.
 |
 |-- For a list of all other changes, please see the changelog.
 |

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.0.0 bug fixes, feature enhancements and vLIB moves to sourceforge.net
 |
 |
 |-- vLIB moves up a major version as it moves to sourceforge
 |    The entire vLIB source is now hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/vlib.
 |    This is seen as a big move to opening up vLIB to other developers. Anyone can access the latest CVS releases
 |    with anonymous access: cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.vlib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vlib co vlib
 |
 |-- vlibTemplateDebug feature enhancement
 |    now opens up the debug module in a javascript window. This is a lot easier to use.
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate bugfix
 |    fixed a bug that prevented the use of adding multiple loops at the same time using the 3-way-loop structure.
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail bugfix
 |    fixed the validateEmail to use preg_match. Before it was case-sensitive and thus not validating correctly.
 |
 |-- vlibDate feature enhancement
 |    added Arabic language pack (docs updated).
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate bugfix
 |    changed setVar() to use !== when verifying whether a var has been set. This allows number 0 to be set and
 |    output. Also changed if(!empty($value)) to if(isset($value)) in _parseif() function to allow a 0 to be parsed
 |	  using the extended <TMPL_IF> syntax, i.e. <TMPL_IF name="amount" value="0">.
 |
 |-- vlibIni/vlibTemplate feature enhancement
 |    added a new option, 'ENABLE_PHPINCLUDE'. When it's set to '0', will disable the use of the <TMPL_PHPINCLUDE>
 |    tag (docs updated)
 |    NB: vlibTemplate still doesn't try to strip out php form the template and normal security measures should still
 |        be taken.
 |
 |-- vLIB distribution change
 |    vLIB will now be distributed with the new documentation. Within the distribution archive, all files will be
 |    contained in a root directory reflecting the current version, i.e. vLIB_4-0-0.
 |
 |-- vLIB documentation addition
 |    a new FAQ.html file will be available in the docs directory of each distribution. This will contain frequently
 |    asked questions and answers.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0.10 Performance enhancement
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate bug fix
 |    Fixed a bug that meant that when including templates using <TMPL_INCLUDE>, the vars were not shown. This
 |    was caused by the changes made to the <TMPL_INCLUDE> functionality and the extract()ing of the $this->_vars
 |    array which were modified in the last 2 releases. The extract()ing has been removed for the time being as
 |    this was not as big a performance increase as the <TMPL_INCLUDE> changes.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0.9 Performance enhancement
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate performance enhancement
 |    Updated the way vlibTemplate handles <TMPL_INCLUDE>'s. Before this version, vlibTemplate would scan
 |	  through each file every time it was called (even from cache) and preg_replace the <TMPL_INCLUDE> tag
 |	  with the template file.
 |	  Now, the <TMPL_INCLUDE> tag is is parsed just once, on the main parse of the file, and then the template
 |	  is read in by. This saves the need of scanning through the file each time searching for <TMPL_INCLUDE>
 |	  tags using preg_replace, it's all done on the main evaluation.
 |	  On large template, this can knock off 75% from the time it takes to parse the file.. with my tests anyway.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0.8
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate feature enhancement
 |    vlibTemplate now supports an extended TMPL_IF syntax. The new OPTIONAL syntax gives you the opportunity
 |    to compare the value of a var name to a number or string. There are 2 attributes that apply to the new
 |    functionality; OP and VALUE. OP is the comparison OPerator that you want to use. The default is '=='
 |    and the supported operators are '==', '!=', '<>', '<', '>', '<=' and '>='. VALUE is the string or number
 |    that you want to compare to (containing any characters except quotes), i.e.:
 |       <TMPL_IF name="my_email" value="vlib@activefish.com">... or <TMPL_IF name="price" op=">" value="50.00">..
 |    NB: to avoid any errors, always encapsulate the values of OP and VALUE in quotes.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate feature enhancement
 |    newTemplate now resets internal parsing variables. This enables multiple template functionality on
 |    the PHP side, i.e. you can create a template object using 1 template, then once you've parsed it,
 |    you can call $tmpl->newTemplate('./path/to/template'); and it's as if you started again, however all of
 |    the variable and loops and options that you set previously will still be in place.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate new language pack
 |    Stefan Isarie has kindly added a Romanian language pack to vlibDate.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplateCache internal enhancement and bugfix
 |    vlibTemplateCache now locks files when writing the cache. Also fixed a bug with the naming mechanisms behind
 |    the caching system which, in some circumstances, would cause multiple cached files for 1 single template.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate language pack fix
 |    BuStEl posted another fix for the Dutch language pack to the Forum.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate internal enhancement
 |    changed internal working of fastPrint to avoid duplication of code.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate performance enhancement
 |    changed internal workings of all parsing functions. vlibTemplate now extracts() all vars in the
 |    $this->_vars array which is used by vlibTemplate to contains all global variables. This is a quicker
 |    way for PHP to process calls instead of searching through an array looking for each value.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate feature enhancement
 |    2 new escaping mechanisms have been added, 'hex' and 'hexentity'. These can be especially handy when
 |    publishing an email address to the web, i.e.
 |    <a href="mailto:{tmpl_var name='email' escape='hex'}">
 |      <tmpl_var name='email' escape='hexentity'></a>
 |    now if the var 'email' is set to 'email@example.com', in the HTML source you will see:
 |    <a href="mailto:%65%6d%61%69%6c%40%65%78%61%6d%70%6c%65%2e%63%6f%6d">
 |      &#x65;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x40;&#x65;&#x78;&#x61;&#x6d;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>
 |    This still works perfectly in a browser, but will be much harder for spiders to collect your email address.
 |    For an example have a look at the vLIB homepage. Wherever you see vlib@activefish.com, it's hex-encoded.
 |
 |
 |-- vLIB temporary change to downloadable archives
 |    I'm currently looking into a new format for writing the docs. Until I've sorted this out, the docs will
 |    only be available at http://vlib.activefish.com.
 |
 |
 |-- vLIB documentation update
 |    Updated vlibTemplate and vlibDate documentation to reflect new changes.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.7 (a quick bug fix release)
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimemail bug fix
 |    Fixed a bug with the Mime format. All emails now have a multipart/alternative section.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.6
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail bug fix
 |    Updated the inner workings of vlibMimeMail to produce more standard compliant Mime code.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail feature enhancement
 |    attach now works with remote files, i.e. $mail->attach('http://example.com/example.xls');
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplateCache enhancements
 |    Updated the vlibTemplateCache class to cache each individual template seperately. Before it would include
 |    all the files included using <tmpl_include> and then would cache one script. Now it caches each individual
 |    file. It also recognizes when a template has changed and automatically updates the cached file. All these
 |    changes mean better maintainability.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate language pack fix
 |    Paul Font Freide submitted a fix to the forum for the Dutch language pack.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate magic_quotes_runtime handler
 |    Now switches off magic_quotes_runtime before reading in the template file, and then resets magic_quotes_runtime
 |    to it's original setting.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.5
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail enhancement
 |    Added a boolean parameter to the instantiation call for vlibMimeMail. When set to true, vlibMimeMail
 |    will compile the email in a way which will hopefully enable the email to by pass the bug in Windows
 |    which causes the mail to fail if used with Cc or Bcc headers or if the 1st parameter passed to mail()
 |    is in the format; "rcpt name" <rcpt_email>.
 |    Instantiation example: $mail = new vlibMimeMail(true); (docs updated)
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail bug fix
 |    Fixed a bug which caused empty Cc: and Bcc: headers to output when not specified.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.4 (feature enhancements, bug fixes, BIG change to ini.php)
 |
 |
 |-- change to the ini.php
 |    ini.php has been renamed to vlibIni.php and made into a class. This class is now included once,
 |    compared to the old "include it when we need it" way, thus improving performace.
 |    I know that this can be perceived as a big change but it really isn't. Although all ini.php
 |    files MUST be updated for the new version of vLIB to work.
 |                              ** Sorry for the inconvenience **
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate performance enhancement
 |    Changed the regex in vlibTemplate::_intiParse() causing a slight speed improvement.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate feature enhancements
 |    added new setDbLoop() function and added more functionality to the 3-stage method
 |    of adding a loop.
 |    Also added 3 more escape methods; rawurl, 1 and 0. 1 and 0 to comply with Perls HTML::Template
 |    Also change fastPrint() to handle gz compression.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail bug fix
 |    Fixed a bug with address formats from; name <email> .. to; "name" <email>.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail feature enhancements
 |    Added 4th parameter to attach() allowing you to specify the Content-ID. If not specified then
 |    a random string is generated and used. attach() now also returns this content-id.
 |    4 new functions added; clearTo(), clearCc(), clearBcc() and clearAll() allowing user to clear the
 |    current list of addresses for the email.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate bug fix
 |    Updated French language pack as this was incorrect. Also updated the getSuffix() function which
 |    caused the suffixes to be generated from the month number and not the day number???
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate feature enhancements
 |    Addes 3rd parameter to weekOfYear() which allows user to control whether the week starts on Sunday
 |    or Monday. Also added new coversion specifier %W which handles new week of year starting on Monday.
 |
 |
 |-- vLIB general code cleanup
 |    The main classes were cleaned up so that they look nicer, and perform in a more standard way.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.3 (a quick documentation fix release)
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate doc fix
 |    Fixed a bug in a documentation example.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.2 (a quick bug fix release)
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimemail bug fix
 |    Fixed a bug which cause the email format to be; email <name> .. instead of ; name <email>
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3.0.1 (a few bug fixes and enhancements)
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate feature inhancement
 |    Added 3 functions allowing for an easier way to add loops.
 |    Suggested by Claus Van Beek, http://www.clausvb.de.
 |
 |
 |-- documentation
 |    added new functions to the docs, and the link to Claus Van Beek's online documentation
 |    in German.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail bug fix
 |    Fixed a simple bug caused when attaching multiple attachments.
 |    Bug found by Francesco Defilippo.
 |
 |
 |-- examples update
 |    Updated the examples, adding a new one for the new loops, and fixing 1 broken link
 |    in the vlibTemplate_include1.html template file.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.0.0 (upgraded to new major version due to changes in naming mechanisms)
 |
 |
 |-- vLIB naming mechanisms
 |    as of 3.0.0 all vLIB class will start with vlib (lower case), i.e. vTemplate will now be vlibTemplate.
 |    This is to avoid confusion with other classes which use similar names.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplate, new Global Context Variable
 |    with the options TIME_PARSE and GLOBAL_CONTEXT_VARS both set to 1, a global variable called
 |    __PARSE_TIME__ (2 underscores either side) will be set with the time taken to parse the template.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibMimeMail new class
 |    a new class to help with sending MIME encoded email with attachements, HTML mail, priority
 |    setting and more. Please see the documentation.
 |
 |
 |-- documentation
 |    added new documentation for vlibMimeMail.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibTemplateCache bug fix
 |    bug reported by vscope in the forums which caused a problem with the caching due to the fact that
 |    when PHP is installed as a CGI on Win32 or on IIS and possibly other server, the $PHP_SELF variable
 |    includes the entire path to the executable, then to the script.
 |    We now use $PATH_INFO if it's available, as it is in CGI and IIS but not as apache module, or $PHP_SELF
 |    otherwise.
 |
 |
 |-- vlibDate new class
 |    a new class for manipulating dates outside of the 1970-2038 32-bit date range.
 |    This class supports dates between 0001 and 9999 and has many functions to manipulate the date
 |    and the way it's displayed. Please see the documentation.
 |
 |
 |-- documentation
 |    added new documentation for vlibDate.
 |
 |
 |-- examples
 |    restructured the examples directory and added examples for vlibMimeMail and vlibDate.
 |    It is now possible to view the source of the examples whilst browsing.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.0.2
 |
 |
 |-- vTemplate performance
 |    made a 'MINOR' change to main pcre call which boosts performance by up to 80%.
 |
 |
 |-- vTemplate performance
 |    changed way in which vTemplate reads files into a var using fopen, fread, fclose
 |    instead of implode(file()). Overall performace changes are minimal but this way of
 |    reading the data is up to 30% faster.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.0.1
 |
 |
 |-- Released vLIB.
 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
