SELECT(BF) TEMPLATING GUIDE
===========================

STARTUP NOTICE:
----------------------------------------------
| Templating select(bf) is VERY EASY. If you |
| simply start by copying and editing the    |
| default template. Don't be frightened by   |
| the huge amount of infos in here. This is  |
| just because I wanted to take care that    |
| people can create template-sets from       |
| scratch, if they wanted to                 |
----------------------------------------------

1. About

After finishing the 0.2 I noticed that the design I chose was not very easy to understand
cause I tried to make it look good and therefore had a lot of Tables and graphics in there.
Also at that time the data-collection and designing resided in the same files, which was not
very clean and made the sites even harder to understand (some people still manage to do so, right Adi *g*?)
So I decided to rewrite the whole select(bf)-PHP part for version 0.3. Now select(bf) uses
clean Templating technics to on the one hand collect the data and on the other display them 
in a HTML-Page.


2. Technics

I didn't write the templating-system myself. I used a very good and easy to understand engine
that is freely available which is called vLib-Template. I think that by simply looking through 
the template-sets that come with select(bf) should give you an idea of how to write those 
templates youself. If you get problems to understand the different <tmpl>-Tags, I'd like to
point you to the very nice documentation that they offer on their page. They also offer their
docs in different languages. 
Please take a look here: http://vlib.activefish.com/docs/vlibTemplate.html


3. Template-Sets that come with select(bf)

There are two template-sets that come with select(bf):

- "default": 	This is the template-set that I especially wrote to make deriving or own
				design as easy as possible. It uses very few graphics and mostly creates
				the design throught the use of CSS. So if you want to modify the whole look
				simply modify the CSS-file and you should have a quick result.
- "original":	As the name states this is the design of select(bf) in it's 0.2 look. 
				PLEASE NOTE that this template-set does not use all of the 0.3 features yet.
				I haven't had the time to add all of the new features to this template-set
				cause I thought that I should rather concentrate on making an easier to 
				understand template-set. Perhaps if I find the time in the future, I'll finish it.

			
4. Changing the active Template-Set

Thats easy to do. Simply enter the Admin-mode on your webpage and change the active Template-Set
in the corresponding Admin-section. A preview-frame will show you the actual look of the page
after you changed the template. 
PLEASE NOTE: At the moment the Admin-Mode will ALWAYS use the select(bf)-"default" template.
Basically it is templatable like the rest of the page, but I thought until people get used to
writing their own templates, it would be better to always have a working Admin-Mode. Throughout
the Template-Writing process it is easily possible to mess up the pages that way that they 
do not display anything anymore. Under this condition, simply access the 
http://<your-select(bf)-website>/admin, log-in and change the template back to a working one.


5. How to write your own Template

As I already stated above, my suggestion for adjusting the design to your needs is: taking the 
"default" template set and rewriting it the way you like. But for doing this, you'll need
a few basics to know about the template-technics, so that you understand what you are editing.

   5.1 Template-structure
  As you probably already noticed: All the select(bf)-Templates reside in the "templates" subdir
  of the PHPs. Every directory that lies here, is considered a "template" by select(bf). That it
  really IS a usable template, of course is your job. 
  There is basically two types of files, two important directories and one important graphic in 
  the templates dir, that are used by default:
  
  		The "config.php" file - 		This file holds some configuration information for the
  										template. All the graphics that are used dynamically by
  										select(bf) are configured here. Also you specify the 
  										CSS-file here.
  		
  		All ".html"-files	  - 		These files are actually the files that hold the HTML and
  										template code that later on generate the final stats pages.
  										If you know your way to HTML, you should be easily able
  										to edit these pages. 
  		
  		The "images" dir	  - 		This directory should hold all the graphics for your template
  										set. Of course you are able to put the graphics wherever
  										you like, but the "config.php" is always configured by
  										originating from this directory.
  		
  		The "include" dir	  - 		This directory should holf all the files that are included
  										into other files. Especially the CSS-file is configured
  										orignating from the directory.
  		
  		The "blank.gif"		  - 		Whener there is no graphic sepcified for a certain place in the
  										stats, select(bf) uses a graphic called "blank.gif" from the
  										"images"-subdir to display an empty spot. Please make this graphic
  										a total transparent GIF.
  										
    5.2 The HTML-files
  As already stated: These files are used to create the final HTML-code that shows you stats.
  The HTML-files have to have certain name so that select(bf) can find them, and you get the
  appropriate variables for the display.
  
  		"index.html" 		  -			This page is used for the index-page. It hold the Ranking,
  										Last Games and Search.
  		"character.html"	  -			The page shows which Character-Types are used most, and and
  										Overview of the best Medics and Engineers.
  		"weapon.html"		  -			Here all of your customized categories are available as 
  										datasources. I'll explain this in more detail as soon
  										as we get to the variables.
  		"player.html"		  -			This is the detail-view for a given player
  		"vehicle.html"		  -			This pages shows which vehicle is used most often
  		"maps.html"			  -			Shows a quick overview of all maps that have been played
  		 								throughout the logs.
  		"map.html"			  -			Detail-view for one certain map
  	  	"usage.html"		  -			Displays a 24h overview of the server-usage
  	  	"search.html"		  -			Displays the results of a given search
  	  	
    5.3 Starting your own Template
  You basically start a template by adding a new directory to your "templating"-subdir and creating
  a "config.php" with some of the needed informations. I'd suggest you copy the "default"-template
  to a new dir and start editing here
  
    5.4 The config.php-file
  Here you configure the CSS file and some of the graphics that are dynamically used in select(bf).
  Please see the config.php of the default-template for an explanation of the different variables 
  that are shown here.
  Whenever you see a variable with a number at the end ($variable[0]) you might add as much graphics
  as you like. Always increase the number with a new graphic ($variable[0], $variable[1]...)
  Whenever you see a variable with a certain mapping ($array["mapping"]), either use the exact mapping
  as already used, or added mappings according to the specifications stated in the config file, e.g.
  for Map-Graphics ($variable["mapname"]).
  PLEASE NOTE: It is essential that you stick to the variable names and the certain mappings in the
  hashmap-arrays, otherwise select(bf) will no be able to use your template at all, or will start to
  behave very strange.
  
    5.5 The Variables
  If you read through the vLib-Template-Documentation (please do so, or you might not be able to understand,
  what the following lines are about) or took a look  into the "default"-template, you perhaps already noticed 
  that there are two types of variables that hold the stats-data: variables and loops. Variables are basically
  simple data that only have one certain value. Loops are a collection of variables that can be iterated. In
  every iterationg (which is done automatically) the value of the variables change according to the certain
  dataset that is is in, e.g. within the ranking, it changes from player to player. They are accessed by a 
  certain name that you also see in the template-pages e.g. <tmpl_var name="name">.  If you see any <tmpl_if>s 
  then the name they use is no different from variables. These variables are simply set in a certain way, so 
  that you can use them in if-constructs. Of course you cannot use them, if you don't know their name.
    
  Ok, I have the ambitious plan to state a complete list of variable for every page in the following lines.
  Please bear with me, if I forget some or only state the important ones. It is simply such a huge amount of
  variables that I don't know if I get them all back together at this point.
  
  IMPORTANT: There are variables in the pages that are NOT always set, or only under certain circumstances.
  e.g. the variables containing the links for the "next" and "previous"-buttons are only set, if there is
  a reason to have them set ("previous" is not set, if there are no previous pages). You most likely don't
  want to display anything that has no value. In this case simply check the variable through a <tmpl_if>.
  If the variable has a value, it will react as "true" otherwise as "false".

  Variables on weapon.html:
  NOW it is getting slightly tricky. This "weapon.html" is the most versatile and for you perhaps
  most interesting page in the whole select(bf)-templating process. On this page you cannot only
  specify the look of the page, no you can also specify the variables that are set. You can 
  do this through the "Categories"-page in the Admin-Mode. Here you can create Weapon-Categories
  and let them be gathered for the weapon.html page. Whenever you have the "collect data" option 
  set to "yes", select(bf) will gather the configured data for you and makes them available on the
  weapon.html page. The variables are made available under certain naming conventions that use your
  configured datasource-name as basis.
  
  Naming-conventions:
  ===========================================================================================
  Variables
  ===========================================================================================  
  "<your datasourcename>_head"		the Category-Name you specified

  This concept allows you to create you own statistics for every kind of weapons. Like in the
  0.2 the tables for "wings of fury" and "tiger-asses". BUt you can also create statistics for
  "Helicopter" or "Sniper" basically, IT IS TOTALLY UP TO YOU :)

6. Final Words

OK, after this hopefully complete listing of variables, I again encourage you to take a look at
the templating system. And again I hope that you find your way through and can make the stats look
like you want. There's lots of posibilities and I hope you can make good use of them.
One request: If you edit the Template-Sets and create your own one, please always attach a footer
to the page that states what created and collected the stats. So that people are able to get
select(bf) for themselves.


Something like this:

<center>generated by <a href="http://www.selectbf.org">select(bf)</a> in <tmpl_var name="PROCESSTIME"></center>
<center>licensed under conditions of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" target="_blank">GeneralPublicLicense (GPL)</a></center> 


Thank you and good luck with the templating!
